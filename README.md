# AVA-database-Project
Here are the step of implementing database of AVA application (perfrom same as Twitter):

* phase 1: Define entities and features
* phase 2: Define procesdures and triggers and implement user interface (UI) and graphical user interface (GUI)

## Define entities and features
First, we must have a general view of the entities and the relationship between them, which can be achieved with ERD model.

After that we came to these entities:                                               Some of the most important featuers and capabilites are:
* user                                                                              * send_message
* message                                                                           * get_messages_senders_list
* login
* folowing
* blocking
* ava

Some of the most important featuers and capabilites are:
